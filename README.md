# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2021

***

### Building

The code is written in Rust, so you'll need to grab a
[Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in order to compile it.

To build :

```
$ git clone https://github.com/TheCarlG/advent2021
$ cd advent2021
$ cargo run --bin day01
```
